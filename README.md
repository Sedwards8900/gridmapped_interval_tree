# Spatial Databases Homework 2 Project

Homework 2 was designed to explore the spatial concepts for Minimum Bounding Boxes, Intervals, and Trajectory objects where its application allows the user to add trajectories to a Grid-Mapped Interval Tree that records locations of polygons in a spatial grid.

The project is also available on github at https://github.com/Sedwards8900/gridmapped_interval_tree
